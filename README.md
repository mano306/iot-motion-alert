# Motion Sensor Security Project (Simulated in Tinkercad)

This is my first IoT project using Arduino UNO and a PIR sensor.  
It detects motion and turns on a light or buzzer as an alert.  
I built and tested it in Tinkercad since I don't have hardware right now.

## What I Learned
- How to connect sensors in Tinkercad
- How to write simple C code in Arduino IDE
- Logic for security system (motion â†’ alert)

## What's Next
I'm planning to upgrade this project to use NodeMCU and connect it to Firebase or Blynk for cloud-based alerts.
